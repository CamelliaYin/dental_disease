# Crowd-YOLO

This is the official repository for Crowd-YOLO, that is based on the [Bayesian Classifier Combination neural network (BCCNet)](https://github.com/OlgaIsupova/BCCNet) and the [YOLO (You Only Look Once)](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) object detection algorithm.
We use the version 5 of all available YOLO algorithms/implementations (a.k.a. YOLOv5).
The latest version of our paper could be found here (@TODO: LINK HERE).

## Directory structure

@TODO: Furnish the directory structure here, and optionally, explain each directory/file's purpose.
